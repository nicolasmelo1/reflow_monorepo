/**
 * Okay, so we've created the consumers and the websockets inside of our framework, why do we do this here and what do we do
 * to handle incoming messages and sending messages.
 * 
 * This was something extracted from the django project before being translated to this node project and that have a similar 
 * interface as it was.
 * 
 * By default we can create consumer classes that will attach to specific routes in our application. We also can add middleware
 * to routes similarly as we do inside our express routes.
 * 
 * We could go with the middleware approach by creating each consumer as a class and attaching it in a specific middleware order
 * inside of each path. The problem with this approach is that: we will recieve all of the messages from the client, how will we dispatch
 * on each consumer what we want to handle?
 * 
 * We don't that's why we need a default structure in our massages so we can dispatch it to the correct consumers. At the same time, each consumer
 * creates it's own group so it can recieve and listen from messages from the layers and dispatch to the connected clients.
 * 
 * Anyway, it can become complex really quickly, but i could also make it work using the middleware approach. Although the middleware
 * approach is good, it might not be clear for the programmer since you won't be using 'settings' but instead appending to `routing` directly
 * so it might not be so clear for the programmers what are the consumers, what routes are they appended to and so on. But keep in mind
 * we can also change this anytime. For the middleware approach to work every consumer would extend from a givin consumer class here and 
 * add the proper `recieve` or `send` methods to it. Then on the base class we will check if `this` have the method `recieve${data.type}` and dispatch
 * the method to the consumer. You should also override the send so all consumers doesn;t handle the same send event since they are all connected
 * to the same group.
 * 
 * ANYWAY, back on how the consumers work.
 * 
 * To create a new base consumer you should extend from the BaseConsumer class and define it here.
 * You will create it like:
 * 
 * ```
 * class UserConsumer extends BaseConsumer {
 *      static groupNameTemplate = 'user_{id}'
 *      consumers = {
 *          ...getMethodsByConsumer('LOGIN_REQUIRED')
 *      }
 * 
 *      static async send(eventName, userId, data) {
 *          this.groupName = UserConsumer.groupNameTemplate.replace('{id}', userId)
 *          await super.send(eventName, this.groupName, data)
 *      }
 * 
 *      async connect(scope, next) {
 *          if (scope.user && ![null, undefined].includes(scope.user)) {
 *              this.groupName = UserConsumer.groupNameTemplate.replace('{id}', scope.user.id)
 *              await super.connect(scope, next)
 *          } else {
 *              throw new websockets.DenyConnection('For `user` group types, your user must be authenticated')
 *          }
 *      }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * See that `consumers` on the 3ยบ line is required in order for it to work. You also should define your own custom `connect` method 
 * so you can create group names dynamically. 
 * 
 * Do you see we have a custom static send method? This is because we want to be able to send messages to a specific user without
 * initializing the class. This automatically broadcast the message to all consumers so it's simple to send the message.
 * 
 * Okay, i understand how i can create custom consumers, so how do we override this consumer and create custom consumers?
 * Remember that `consumers` object is obligatory in your class? See the `getMethodsByConsumer('LOGIN_REQUIRED')` part.
 * 
 * Whet we do is that on `settings.js` we define the consumers we want to override as a string in a particular key like:
 * ```
 * const CONSUMERS = {
 *      LOGIN_REQUIRED: [
 *          'src/data/consumers/DataConsumer',
 *          'src/billing/consumers/BillingConsumer',
 *          'src/authentication/consumers/AuthenticationConsumer'
 *      ],
 *      PUBLIC: [
 *          'src/draft/consumers/DraftPublicConsumer',
 *      ],
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * See that we have a key called `LOGIN_REQUIRED` and we have an array of strings with the paths to the consumers we want to use, also see that we have
 * the key `PUBLIC` for another pair of consumers.
 * 
 * Okay, nice, so how do we create a custom consumer in our application?
 * Like this:
 * ```
 * const AuthenticationConsumer = {
 *      recieveMessage: async (scope, data) => { // you can follow either this format for defining your functions
 *          console.log(data)
 *      },
 *      async sendTeste(scope, data, send) { // or this format for defining your functions
 *          send(data)
 *      }
 * }
 * 
 * module.exports = {
 *      AuthenticationConsumer // You should export it like this, don't ever export your consumer like ```module.exports = AuthenticationConsumer```
 * } 
 * ```
 * 
 * Firt things first: Your custom consumer is not a class, but a simple object. Second you have 2 functions: `recieveMessage` and `sendTeste`
 * when your function have the `recieve` keyword, this means your function will recieve the data from the client that had the following `type`. Be
 * aware that `type` key is required in the object you send and the object you recieve.
 * We send a data like
 * ```
 * {
 *    type: 'message',
 *    data: { hello: 'world'}
 * }
 * ```
 * We use the 'type' part on the data to dispatch it to the correct consumers. Then again, if your function have the `recieve` keyword this function
 * will handle when it recieves a data from the client. When it has the `send` keyword this means we will override how we send the data to the user.
 * If no function is found it just send the data to the client normally. 
 * 
 * Last but not least, how do we send data to the client easily? Use the static `send` method. (it's not the same as the non static `send` method)
 * ```
 * UserConsumer.send('teste', 1, { hello: 'world'}) // This will send for the group `user_1` the data { hello: 'world'}
 * UserConsumer.send('teste', 2, { hello: 'world2'}) // This will send for the group `user_2` the data { hello: 'world2'}
 * 
 * BaseConsumer.send('teste', 'user_2', {hello: 'world2'}) // Same as the previous example
 * ```
 * 
 * See that by doing this we append the `type` to the event directly so you don't need to worry about it when sending events.
